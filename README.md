# NurseEase
The app helps to optimise the work of the nurses by automating and visualising the vital signs of the patients. The idea is to ease the work of the nurses by providing a user interface that helps them track the vital signs of the patients assigned to them and also provide alerts in case of an emergency. The app mostly uses FHIR resource to enable interoperability and also enable seamless integration into the current workflow setting
